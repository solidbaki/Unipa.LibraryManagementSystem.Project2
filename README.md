# Unipa.LibraryManagementSystem.Project2

This project is the second project I am developing for my place of internship, UNIPA. 

Library Management System is designed for being helpful to the library keeper in a library, to keep book records and student records together with their relative manipulations. 

Library Management System aims to give the maximum functionality for it's requirements with a simple GUI.
