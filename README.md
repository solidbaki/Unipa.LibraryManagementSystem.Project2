# Unipa.LibraryManagementSystem.Project2

This project is the second project I am delivering for my place of internship, UNIPA. 
Library Management System is designed for being helpful to the library keeper in a library, with student and book records and relative manipulations. 
It is not possible to manage more than one library with the system but the sytem can be adapted for different libraries.
